I am personally very interested in how Data Hubs might be formalized and standardized at RWOT9, and am typing up some of my hare-brained thoughts in the hopes that they indirectly contribute to bringing new people into that discussion and translating between the ongoing conversation among Hub thinkers and others happening elsewhere. 

#### Delegation versus mandate? 

See Rieks' topic paper for a potentially useful distinction in how decisions and reporting might be done on behalf of a data hub controller.

#### Can non-humans hub?  

How does the data hub model work differently when the "individual" creating and storing data documents is not an individual human but rather a legal person?  Can a smart device (think a car, not a lightbulb), maybe even a device not yet sold or owned, write to a data hub?  What would be required for "anything with a DID" be able to write to hubs?

#### Can (and should) hubs host government-facing data?  

GDPR and other data regimes create a firm distinction between the reporting rights and obligations data processors have towards government and private-sector actors.  For instance, many kinds of data that a processor is penalized for leaking or sharing with third parties, they would also be penalized for *not* sharing with governments according to the conditions imposed by national law.  Could data hubs be built with this distinction in mind?  More broadly, how will the data architecture of hubs treat the divergence of regulatory needs for different markets?

#### Can (and should) hubs host some minimal form of "reputation" data available to non-governmental organizational entities?  

I don't mean social credit scores (or at least, I hope what I'm thinking of does not naturally or necessarily lead to such that kind of reputation), but the more protocol-layer issues of spam-filtering and whitelisting by analogy to SMTP and older open protocols.  Would it be *beneficial* to leak or publicize some modicum of information about, say, the history or KYC status or personhood of the owner of an account? Could a special category somewhere between government and "everyone else" be created, for intermediaries that, say, build spam blacklists?  If so, under what conditions of neutrality, funding/equity model, government charter, social participation/makeup, "research purposes", etc?
