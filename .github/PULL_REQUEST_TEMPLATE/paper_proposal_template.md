  [Topical Listing](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/tree/master/topics-and-advance-readings#topical-listing)
  section of `/topics-and-advance-readings/README.md` (adding a new category describing your topic, if necessary).
  Your entry should have the following format:
  
    ```
    * [Paper Title](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot9-prague/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/your_paper_filename.md)
